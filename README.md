# Show My Patient ID Trial

This repository contains the source code for running the Innovation Lab's Show My Patient ID trial in a live healthcare setting.

Show My Patient ID generates a QR code containing patient data obtained from NHS Login.  The QR code generation can be entirely done on the client, but the NHS Login integration at present requires a server-side component to hold a secret.

The initial commit of this repository only contains the client.  See the `trial-client` directory.
